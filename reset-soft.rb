  When you are working a feature or bug, you will often find it helpful to create frequent commits that track your overall progress.  When it is time to share your changes, however, you may not want each step to appear in the history of the project.  Using the command `git reset --soft` allows you to step backwards in your commit history while leaving your working directory and staging area intact so you can combine all of those commits into a single snapshot.

  It is kind of like remodeling a kitchen.  Maybe there are multiple contractors who are each responsible for a particular component.  The person overseeing the overall progress might not necessarily be concerned with how each component is constructed â€” only that the components are complete and installed.

  This repository contains files that each represent a finished component of a kitchen remodel.  You have a branch called `flooring` that contains individual commits for each step of the flooring process.  If you run `git reset --soft HEAD~5`, Git will rewind your commit history, leaing all of the changes those commits introduced intact and staged.  From there, you can run `git commit -m 'Add flooring'` to combine all of those individual changes into a single commit."
